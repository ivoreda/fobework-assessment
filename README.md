# Music Booking Application Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the proposed architecture for the music booking application designed to handle a large concurrent user base efficiently.

## System Architecture

### Key Components
1. **Microservices Architecture**
    - Decoupled services for modularity and scalability
    - Independent deployment and scaling of individual services
    - Services include:
        - User Service
        - Event Service
        - Payment Service
        - Notification Service

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**:
    - Java Spring Boot
    - Reactive Programming (Project Reactor)
    - WebFlux for non-blocking I/O
- **Database**:
    - PostgreSQL for primary data storage
    - Redis for caching and session management
- **Payment Integration**:
    - Mock Paystack Service (for demonstration)
    - Supports asynchronous payment processing
- **Messaging**:
    - Apache Kafka for event-driven communication between services

### Scalability Features

#### Concurrency Handling
- Reactive programming model using Project Reactor
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Bounded elastic schedulers for offloading CPU-intensive tasks
- Supports high concurrent user loads

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless service design
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration and auto-scaling
- Load balancing at application and infrastructure levels

### Key Design Patterns
- Reactive Programming Pattern
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

### Performance Optimizations
- Caching layer with Redis
- Efficient database indexing
- Connection pooling
- Asynchronous processing of non-critical tasks

## Payment Processing Flow
1. User initiates ticket booking
2. Payment service generates unique transaction reference
3. Async payment verification
4. Ticket allocation with concurrency controls
5. Robust error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Authentication and Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure payment transaction handling
- Protection against race conditions in ticket booking

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for event recommendations
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multi-region deployment
- Enhanced fraud detection mechanisms

## Limitations of Current Implementation
- Mock payment service (not a real payment gateway)
- Simplified error handling
- Demonstration of core architectural concepts

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Docker and Kubernetes
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run services using docker-compose
5. Access application through API gateway

## Deployment Considerations
- Use container orchestration
- Implement robust monitoring
- Set up auto-scaling policies
- Configure database read replicas

## Performance Benchmarks
- Designed to handle 10,000+ concurrent users
- Sub-100ms response times for critical operations
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

## Contribution Guidelines
- Follow reactive programming principles
- Maintain immutability
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Adhere to SOLID principles
